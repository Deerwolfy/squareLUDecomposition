# SquareLUDecomposition
My solution to assignment from my college. Computes LU decomposition of square matrix using sequential and parallel programs. For this project was used MSMPI parallel API. The repository contains a solution created by Visual Studio 2019.
## Files
- LU_sequential.c LU decomposition with one process.
- LU_Parallel_PeqN.c decomposition when number of processes equals number of rows in the matrix.
- LU_Parallel.c decomposition with arbitrary matrix dimension and number of processes.
